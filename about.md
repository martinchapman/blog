Posts in this blog are designed to be [_postcards to the
future_](https://vukutu.com/blog/2010/07/postcards-to-the-future/'), documenting, at the time, activities within a
number of different [areas](/tags).
<br>
<br>
Making the content here public, rather than noting it privately, adds weight, and self-hosting on this subdomain
differentiates it from the work-based content posted on the [root domain](https://martinchapman.co.uk) and on social
media sites.
<br>
<br>
These sites include [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/martinchapman.bsky.social),
[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@martinchapman) and [Twitter (X)](https://x.com/martin_chap_man).
