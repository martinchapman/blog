title: the evolution of a personal brand

_Personal branding_ is popular in the [graphic design community](https://yesimadesigner.com/brand-yourself-designers/).
It emphasises the importance of associating images (e.g. logos), colours and fonts with oneself, as this creates consistency, uniqueness, and can tell a story beyond any work presented.

I have explored the idea of a personal brand over the years, initially in relation to my then freelance web design work and more recently to generally augment my work-related online presence. 
Some of this exploration is documented below.

## Logo

### Early efforts

Early efforts at personal branding via a logo (and often associated homepage), referencing either just my name or a constructed brand name, ranged considerably in quality {% include ref.html ref="logos over the years" %}.

{%
  include figure.html
  src="/assets/images/posts/personal-branding/logos.png"
  alt="logos over the years"
%}

Efforts of note include _Monkey! Tiger! Llama??_ {% include ref.html ref="'Monkey! Tiger! Llama??'" %}, an esoteric brand name designed to emphasise the uniqueness of outputs (the appearance of a llama does not fit the sequence), but was ultimately too conceptually convoluted.
It was likely inspired by [similar brands](https://web.archive.org/web/20161004200032/http://3sheep.co.uk/) at the time.

{%
  include figure.html
  src="https://portfolio.martinchapman.co.uk/images/portfolio-1.jpg"
  alt="'Monkey! Tiger! Llama??'"
%}

Similarly, _Genius In a Jar_ {% include ref.html ref="'Genius In A Jar'" %}, another brand name, gave the impression of self-declared genius, rather than the intended interpretation: the genius (i.e. novelty) of the sites developed.
<br />
Regardless, a homage to this site remains in the footer of my [design work archive](https://portfolio.martinchapman.co.uk).

{%
  include figure.html
  src="https://portfolio.martinchapman.co.uk/images/portfolio-12.jpg"
  alt="'Genius In A Jar'"
%}



### Chap-man

A more recent logo-based branding effort sought to play on the fact that the two constituent syllables in 'Chapman' are both synonyms for male ('[chap](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/chap)' and 'man').
Accordingly, a logo was produced showing two simplified male faces.
This logo formed the basis of the first homepage that departs from the sole focus on web design {% include ref.html ref="'martinchapman.co.uk'" %}.

{%
  include figure.html
  src="https://portfolio.martinchapman.co.uk/images/portfolio-11.jpg"
  alt="'martinchapman.co.uk'"
%}

This logo has taken several forms over the years, and remains present as a favicon and in CSS form in the footer of my [work-based pages](https://martinchapman.co.uk).

## Colours

In more recent years, focus has shifted to colours as a form of personal branding.

The colour <span class="chapman p-2"><a href="https://coolors.co/909cc2">#909CC2</a></span> (cool gray) has been selected as a brand colour, and is used across sites including LinkedIn {% include ref.html ref="brand colours on LinkedIn" %}, and in other locations, such as a foreground colour on my work-based pages.

{%
  include figure.html
  src="/assets/images/posts/personal-branding/linkedin.png"
  alt="brand colours on LinkedIn"
%}

Similarly, <span class="jar p-2"><a href="https://coolors.co/ff1744">#FF1744</a></span> (red (munsell)) is used in my design work archive.

Whole palettes have also been used as branding, such as for [kclhi.org](https://kclhi.github.io/) {% include ref.html ref="kclhi.org palette" %}.
As in this case, I typically use the excellent site [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/u/martinchapman) to keep track of palettes used in branding efforts, and aesthetically pleasing palettes I observe more generally and want to record for future use (e.g. using the [image picker](https://coolors.co/image-picker)).
Some palettes are also an opportunity for a [pop culuture nod](https://coolors.co/user/palettes/68bd9e724d1f36000b61f2ce).

<figure id="kclhi.org-palette" class="image">
  <script src="https://coolors.co/palette-widget/widget.js"></script>
  <script data-id="04163045228837593">
    new CoolorsPaletteWidget("04163045228837593", ["1a535c","4ecdc4","f7fff7","ff6b6b","ffe66d"],"kclhi.org"); 
  </script>
  <figcaption>kclhi.org palette</figcaption>
</figure>

In general, the flexibility to 'own' certain colours, due to the wide range available, and the power of these colours to create consistency as part of a brand, is really interesting.

## Fonts

The use of fonts as part of a self-brand is less pronounced, but the font [Source Serif 4](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+4) is used consistently across my work-based pages, for example.

Text in general, however, can be used effectively as part of a brand.
I have, for example, consistently used a double hyphen (broadly an em dash substitute) in the salutation component of an email ('_Hi \<recipient\> \-\-_'), rather than the more standard comma.
