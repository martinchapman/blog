"Call me sentimental, but I like to take pictures of the things I'm about to part with, to soften the blow. 
This is something that I still do from time to time -- just the other day I took a picture of an old pair of nail clippers before I got rid of them. 
You're probably wondering what I do with these images. 
I don't think I've ever even looked at them myself. 
I take them to preserve the memories that are associated with these belongings."
<br />
"I can say from experience that it's very unlikely that you'll actually go back and look at the images. 
I've taken thousands of pictures and I think I'm just about ready to delete them. 
When I do, I know it'll mean that I've started to become more focused on the present."
