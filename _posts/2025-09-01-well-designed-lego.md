The [Triwizard Tournament: The Black Lake (76420)](https://brickset.com/sets/76420-1/Triwizard-Tournament-The-Black-Lake) (Harry Potter theme) contains five features that typify a well-designed Lego set:

1\. *Miniature world*. 
The set represents a miniature world, creating a level of immersion not found in other types of sets (e.g. [sculptures](https://brickset.com/sets/tag-Sculptures))[^1].

[^1]: immersive miniature worlds can also be found in [other types of models](https://www.miniatur-wunderland.de/) and [forms of art](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_WlRJBH3Fl).

2\. *Simplicity*.
A relatively small number of pieces (349) are used efficiently to communicate a lot about the environment being modelled.
The floating effect, for example, is simple but effective.

3\. *Minifigures*.
A range of characters with different characteristics are creatively captured within (broadly) the constraints of a minifigure.
More detailed praise of the minifigures in this set is available [here](https://brickset.com/article/92233/review-76420-triwizard-tournament-the-black-lake).

4\. *Configurable*.
The set is configurable and thus multi-functional {% include ref.html ref="set split to create separate displays" %}.

5\. *Underwater theme*.
Sets with an underwater theme, like this one, are often the strongest.
This includes the famed [Lego Aquanauts](https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Aquazone/subtheme-Aquanauts) ({% include ref.html ref="Neptune Discovery Lab (6195)" text="example pictured" %}).

<hr />

The images {% include ref.html ref="minifigures" text="pictured above" %} were captured by placing the model in an acrylic display case (24 x 14 x 12 cm), the height of which almost perfectly aligns with the top of the underwater section {% include ref.html ref="full set and case" %}.
This allows for the boat accessory to be balanced at an appropriate height, and film positioned on the sides of the case to create the illusion of water.
<br>
This adds a practical element prior to photographing and editing (using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)), and creates a reasonable real-world effect short of filling the case with [actual water](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdVDDJ7X/).
